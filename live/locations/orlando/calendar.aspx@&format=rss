<p style="text-align: center;">Kesha&rsquo;s latest album 'High Road' was called a body of work &ldquo;wise and wild in equal measure&rdquo; (Billboard), that &ldquo;electrifies from the inside out&rdquo; (American Songwriter) and &ldquo;strikes a believable balance between vulnerability and the bluster she made her name on&rdquo; (Stereogum).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Her previous album 'Rainbow', called "an artistic feat" by Entertainment Weekly and "the best music of her career" by Rolling Stone, earned Kesha the first GRAMMY nominations of her career.</p>

In 2016 she won Billboard's Women in Music Trailblazer Award and in 2018 she was named one of Time Magazine's Time 100, their list of the most influential people in the world.</p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/22005ABBC6B1A8A2">CLICK HERE FOR TICKETS</a><br />]]></a10:content></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1533652</guid><title>Primus: A Tribute To Kings with special guests The Sword *SOLD OUT*</title><description>Monday, August 30, 2021 7:00 PM - 11:45 PM - Music - Primus  - Hard Rock Live Orlando - 6050 Universal Boulevard, Orlando, Florida, 32819, United States - Hard Rock Live and 101.1 WJRR Present PRIMUS: A TRIBUTE TO KINGS with special guest THE SWORD</description><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:00:00 -0400</pubDate><a10:link href="https://www.hardrock.com/live/locations/orlando/calendar.aspx?date=8/30/2021&amp;display=event&amp;eventid=1533652" /><a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[Monday, August 30, 2021<br>7:00 PM - 11:45 PM<br>Music<br>Primus <br>Hard Rock Live Orlando<br>6050 Universal Boulevard<br>Orlando, Florida, 32819<br>United States<br><p>$60.50 Balcony Tables</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><em><img alt="" src="files/3626/Nikki_Glaser_New_640x420.JPG" /></em></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nikki Glaser&nbsp;is one of the funniest female voices in comedy today. For over a decade at clubs across the country, and as the host of three hit podcasts, she has been honing her shockingly- honest, no-holds barred style of comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You can currently find Nikki flexing her over-sharing muscle as the host of Comedy Central&rsquo;s first live daily morning show, YOU UP WITH NIKKI GLASER for SiriusXM, which is entirely&nbsp;female-produced.&nbsp; Nikki&rsquo;s recent Netflix comedy special, BANGIN&rsquo;, was released October 2019.&nbsp; BANGIN&rsquo; was the most watched Netflix special of the month and VULTURE included it on their &ldquo;10 Best Comedy Specials of 2019&rdquo; year-end list.&nbsp; In late January, she kicked off her nationwide comedy tour, BANG IT OUT!&nbsp; Previously, Nikki hosted, co-created and executive produced the&nbsp;critically-acclaimed&nbsp;and daring comedic show, NOT SAFE WITH NIKKI GLASER, for Comedy Central and NIKKI &amp; SARA LIVE for MTV.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nikki was a standout at the Comedy Central Roasts of Alec Baldwin, Bruce Willis and Rob Lowe, and has had memorable film and television roles in Judd Apatow&rsquo;s TRAINWRECK, NBC&rsquo;s AP BIO and INSIDE AMY SCHUMER, amongst others.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nikki has multiple stand-up specials and late-night tv appearances in which she jokes about her most humiliating moments as a woman in the modern world. Nikki&rsquo;s past and current struggles with anorexia, depression, and anxiety are fair game in both her stand-up, and in in-depth interviews with THE HOWARD STERN SHOW, WTF WITH MARC MARON and JOE ROGAN. She has become a complete open book on mic - and not just for the laughs, she&rsquo;s also adamant on being the empowering voice for women that she yearned for as a young, confused, adolescent herself.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maze featuring Frankie Beverly has established a trust fund with music lovers worldwide.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Fans know when they attend a Maze concert they will be treated to an evening of honest, raw soul music. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s how it has been for more than 40 years. Nothing has changed. The band has stayed in its lane, continuing to do its thing, bringing quality music from the heart night after night. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the band members&rsquo; honesty and brilliant artistry that has allowed them to continue to headline at top concert venue across the globe. There are no gimmicks, no stage tricks in their shows. Just Beverly with his smooth, soulful vocals supported by the tight Maze band.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;They know what they are going to get with us, &ldquo;says Beverly of the group&rsquo;s audiences. &ldquo;They trust us as musicians. You&rsquo;ve got to be a good live act. You&rsquo;ve got to know how to entertain. It goes beyond having hit records. You have to know how to present the music on stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beverly notes, &ldquo;Our honesty comes through. We don&rsquo;t compromise on being honest with our music and being honest with our approach to our music.&nbsp; We are honest with our fans and I hate to use that word &lsquo;fans&rsquo;, because they are more than that to us. They are our family. They believe in us night after night year after year. And you can&rsquo;t ever lose with your family&rsquo;s support and love. And we recognize that and love them for loving us.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maze featuring Frankie Beverly arrived on the scene in 1977 with a string of hits including Happy Feelings, Lady of Magic, While I&rsquo;m Alone and Workin&rsquo; Together. And the soul classics continued with Golden Time Of Day, Southern Girl, Joy and Pain, We Are One, Running Away, Back In <br />
Stride, Can&rsquo;t Get Over You, Silky Soul and The Morning After. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; The essential must-have Maze albums include Joy and Pain (1980),&nbsp; Live In New Orleans (1981), We Are One (1983), Can&rsquo;t Stop The love (1985) and Live in Los Angeles (1986). Maze was saluted by Mary J. Blige, Avant, Ledisi and other acts on the 2009 hit CD, Silky Soul Music: An All-</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Star Tribute To Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beverly reveals that while he loves singing all of the favorites in concert, he particularly enjoys performing We Are One and Joy and Pain. &ldquo;They have a special place in my heart. We Are One jumps out at me every night. People react the same way. They recognize the song&rsquo;s truth. I see them look at each other and say, &lsquo;Wow, we are one, you are right.&rsquo; I just love what that song does to people, how it unites us all. That song moves me and turns into a spiritual thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to Joy and Pain, the music master notes, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have a mountain without a valley, they are one in the same.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve got flowers, you&rsquo;ve got to have rain. Pretty flowers don&rsquo;t grow without some rain.&rdquo; He was inspired to write the tune after reading philosopher-poet Kahlil Gibran&rsquo;s masterpiece, &ldquo;The Prophet&rdquo;, that includes the chapter, &ldquo;On Joy And Sorrow.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maze&rsquo;s fans are familiar with the band&rsquo;s rise to fame. A native of Philadelphia, Beverly grew up singing in church and later formed a group called The Butlers when he was a teenager. He later changed the name to Frankie Beverly&rsquo;s Raw Soul. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; The band&rsquo;s star began to rise in the mid 70s when Marvin Gaye caught their show in the San Francisco/Oakland area. He took them on the road as his opening act and urged them to change their name from Raw Soul. Original member Roame came up with the name Maze and the rest, as they say, is musical history.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other original Maze member was the late McKinley &ldquo;Bug&rdquo; Williams who played percussions and sang background. Williams died in 2011. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &ldquo;Bug was my brother,&rdquo; recalls Beverly. &ldquo;He was with me for 50 years. We were 15 and 16 when we met. He was an excellent, schooled musician, top of the line. He knew music. He was the father of the band, very much like the guardian of the band. He was very strong-willed and very well respected. He was a good person; he kept the band in line. Someone asked me if I was going to replace him. I said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s impossible, there is no replacing Bug.&rsquo; We started out as seven back in Philly and we are now back to seven. And I really feel that&rsquo;s the way it should be.&nbsp; I love my brother, Bug and miss him so much. But thankfully he is still very much in our music night after night.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverly loves to talk about two of his biggest inspirations&mdash;Frankie Lymon and Sam Cooke. &ldquo;I was Frankie Lymon crazy when he came on the scene. People would call me &lsquo;Little Frankie.&rsquo; My name is Howard, but I took the name Frankie from Frankie Lymon. I used to sing Frankie Lymon songs on street corners. People use to throw me money,&rdquo; he recalls. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beverly says he will never forget meeting Sam Cooke at Philly&rsquo;s Uptown Theater. &ldquo;We were trying to get his autograph. We said, &ldquo;Mr. Cooke, Mr. Cooke, can you sign mine?&rsquo;&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;Have you guys ever been back stage?&rsquo; Well, come on.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; Cooke treated Beverly and his friends &ldquo;like we were his kids.&rdquo;&nbsp; That chance meeting had a tremendous impact &nbsp;on Beverly. To this day, he always makes time for his fans. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t turn people down. I always think of Sam Cooke and how kind and patient he was. He didn&rsquo;t have to do that for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">There are few artists whose names are synonymous with one instrument and how it's played in service to an entire genre.<br />
<br />
Utter the phrase "young blues rock guitarist" within earshot of anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the modern musical vanguard and the first name they are most likely to respond with will be Kenny Wayne Shepherd. The Louisiana born axeman and songsmith has sold millions of albums while throwing singles into the Top 10, shining a light on the rich blues of the past and forging ahead with his own modern twist on a classic sound he has embodied since his teens.<br />
<br />
In a 20-year recording career that began when he was just 16, Shepherd has established himself as an immensely popular recording artist, a consistently in-demand live act and an influential force in a worldwide resurgence of interest in the blues.<br />
<br />
From television performances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon (amongst others) to features in Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, Maxim Magazine, Blender, Spin, USA Today and more, his musical career has been nothing short of phenomenal.<br />
<br />
At 16 years old, he signed his first record deal and burst onto the national scene with the release of his 1995 debut album Ledbetter Heights, which produced the radio hits "Deja Voodoo," "Born with a Broken Heart" and "Shame, Shame, Shame." His relentless touring and success on rock radio helped to drive the album to Platinum sales status. His 1998 sophomore effort Trouble Is... also went Platinum, yielding such radio hits as "Blue on Black," "True Lies" and "Somehow, Somewhere, Someway." 1999's Live On spawned the radio hits "In 2 Deep," "Shotgun Blues" and "Last Goodbye."<br />
<br />
2004's The Place You're In was a blistering rock record and was followed up by 2007's ambitious 10 Days Out: Blues from the Backroads, for which Shepherd and his band traveled throughout the American South to record with such vintage blues greats as B.B. King, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins and David "Honeyboy" Edwards on their home turf. 2010 saw the release of Shepherd's long-awaited first live album, Live! In Chicago, recorded at Chicago's House of Blues during the all-star Legends tour and featuring guest appearances by such blues legends as Hubert Sumlin and Willie "Big Eyes" Smith. The live disc debuted at #1 on Billboard's Blues chart, as did 2011's How I Go. In 2013, Shepherd further expanded his musical horizons by teaming with veteran rockers Stephen Stills and Barry Goldberg to form THE RIDES, whose first album Can't Get Enough helped to expand Shepherd's audience as well as his musical resume. 2014 saw the release of Goin' Home, Shepherd's sixth # 1 debut on the Billboard Blues charts. Goin' Home features several talented friends who shared Shepherd's enthusiasm for the project's back-to-basics ethos. Those guests include fellow guitar icons Joe Walsh, Warren Haynes, Keb' Mo' and Robert Randolph, longtime friend Ringo Starr, Fabulous Thunderbirds frontman Kim Wilson, the Rebirth Brass Band and co-producer Blade's father, Pastor Brady Blade Sr., who lends a bracing dose of preaching to Shepherd's version of Bo Diddley's' "You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover." In the months since its release, Shepherd and his band have toured the world extensively blazing a fresh trail for the historical American art form in the 21st Century.</p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/the-kenny-wayne-shepherd-band-orlando-florida-02-14-2021/event/2200597CA1DD7A73">CLICK HERE FOR TICKETS</a><br />]]></a10:content></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1711867</guid><title>Theory Of A Deadman with special guest Cory Marks</title><description>Friday, September 17, 2021 8:00 PM - 11:00 PM - Music - Hard Rock Live Orlando - 6050 Universal Boulevard, Orlando, Florida, 32819, United States - Hard Rock Live &amp; 101.1 WJRR Present Theory of a Deadman featuring Cory Marks</description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 20:00:00 -0400</pubDate><a10:link href="https://www.hardrock.com/live/locations/orlando/calendar.aspx?date=9/17/2021&amp;display=event&amp;eventid=1711867" /><a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[Friday, September 17, 2021<br>8:00 PM - 11:00 PM<br>Music<br>Hard Rock Live Orlando<br>6050 Universal Boulevard<br>Orlando, Florida, 32819<br>United States<br><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>$45.50 Tables &amp;&nbsp;</strong>Lower Balcony Seating</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Mixing country music with the hard-hitting stomp of rock &amp; roll, Cory Marks prepares to release new music. Full of autobiographical storytelling, guitar-driven anthems, drinking songs, and breakup ballads, his songs are rooted in the influence of Cory's hometown, where he grew up surrounded by the salt-of-the-earth residents of North Bay, Ontario. It was there where he began playing drums at ten years old. Whenever he wasn't banging along to songs by Deep Purple, Ozzy Osbourne, and Rush, he was listening to his parents' country records, developing a deep appreciation for outlaws like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard. Those two genres &mdash; classic country and amped-up rock &mdash; would eventually join forces in Marks' own music, earning him a string of gigs with heavyweights like Toby Keith and Brantley Gilbert along the way. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Before launching his songwriting career, and changing the trajectory of his life, Marks would prove himself in the hockey rink and pursue dreams of becoming a fighter pilot. He strapped on his first pair of skates at 3 years old, eventually earning a spot on the university hockey team at Royal Military College, and was a dominating presence on the ice, thanks to his 6-foot 1 inch, 220-pound frame. Prior to attending college, he enrolled in a private pilot school were he logged in almost 100 flight hours and eventually had the opportunity to fly one of those hours with the Canadian Forces Snowbirds in the summer of 2017. He continues working towards his private pilot license. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;While in college, he never stopped playing music but did so privately&hellip; that is, until he joined his teammates at a local bar one night, and found himself pushed onstage when the regularly-scheduled musician took a break. "My friends knew I played a little music, and they were chanting for me to do some songs," he remembers. "It was a packed little bar. I did two originals and two covers, and afterward, people were coming up to me and asking where I was playing next. I didn't have an answer for them, because this was literally the first time I'd ever sung in front of anyone." Cory began making weekly trips to the bar, hopping onstage with each visit. As time went on, he wrote a new batch of songs, hit the road, and hasn't looked back since. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;A road warrior, Cory has built a strong following not only in Canada, but also in America, where he has been recording with award-winning producer, Kevin Churko. Along with Kevin&rsquo;s son Kane &ndash; the Juno Award-winning producer and songwriter, the three of them worked together in Churko's Las Vegas studio, capturing the energy and electricity of Cory's live show. It was a natural partnership. Like Cory, Kevin had grown up playing drums, eventually expanding his career to include collaborations with country artists like Shania Twain and rock icons like Ozzy Osbourne. "We both appreciate country music greats like Merle Haggard and Waylon Jennings, but we love the heavier side of rock &amp; roll and metal, too," Cory says of his producer and mentor. "We decided to mash it all together. It's funny, because when I was growing up, my favorite records were Ozzy records. I dreamt of having that kind of production on one of my own records. Sure enough, seven years into my career, I've partnered with the producer who worked on all those albums. What a cool circle."</p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/22005A9DDB98AE20 ">CLICK HERE FOR TICKETS</a><br />]]></a10:content></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1731801</guid><title>Hard Rock Live &amp; Foundation Present The Front Bottoms</title><description>Wednesday, September 22, 2021 7:30 PM - 10:00 PM - Music - Hard Rock Live Orlando - 6050 Universal Boulevard, Orlando, Florida, 32819, United States - Hard Rock Live &amp; Foundation Present The Front Bottoms with special guests Oso Oso &amp; Sydney Sprague</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 19:30:00 -0400</pubDate><a10:link href="https://www.hardrock.com/live/locations/orlando/calendar.aspx?date=9/22/2021&amp;display=event&amp;eventid=1731801" /><a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[Wednesday, September 22, 2021<br>7:30 PM - 10:00 PM<br>Music<br>Hard Rock Live Orlando<br>6050 Universal Boulevard<br>Orlando, Florida, 32819<br>United States<br><p><strong>$40.00&nbsp;</strong>Balcony Tables &amp; Lower Balcony Seating</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="files/3626/20-HRCSE-01848_-_MAJAH_HYPE_Digital_640x420.jpg" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Passions for building communities and creating strong representation of Caribbean descendants in mainstream culture are what give comedian Majah Hype his secret sauce. Beginning in 2012, the raspy-voiced funnyman known to his adoring fans as &ldquo;the Caribbean King of Comedy&rdquo; took social media by storm with his brand of humor he calls &ldquo;reality comedy.&rdquo; Producing and starring in sketches online featuring impersonations of characters that poke fun at various stereotypes associated with Caribbean, Latin, and African-American cultures. As a stand-up comedian, Majah improvises his routines: delivering unscripted punchlines around every day experiences that connect Afro-Caribbean people. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Majah was always destined to entertain crowds and bring joy to diverse audiences. Born Nigel Joseph in the Caribbean, Majah grew up the oldest of three children with his mother in Brooklyn, N.Y. The diligent entertainer synonymous with mimicking Caribbean accents honed his chops winning his family&rsquo;s holiday talent shows and either telling jokes or playing seven instruments: mainly the alto saxophone, clarinet, and trombone. Any other time, Majah was taking his inspiration for making people laugh by studying Redd Foxx on &ldquo;Sandford &amp; Son,&rdquo; Jamaican comic Oliver Samuels, Richard Pryor, Martin Lawrence, Jerry Seinfeld, and Eddi Murphy. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For awhile, music seemed to be the career path Majah was destined to pursue. In junior high school, Majah started DJing. One of his DJ buddies gave him the name &ldquo;Majah&rdquo; because he could see the comedian was destined for worldwide success. Majah began selling his cassette tapes sequenced with Caribbean sounds and Hip-Hop to his peers in the hallways. Adding vocals and production to his growing list of talents, Majah produced singles for a host of Jamaican and Caribbean artists like Gyptian and Torres Riley. Almost instantly, the reality of becoming a father at 19 years old forced Majah to put his dreams to mesmerize his audiences on hold. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Majah took a job as an electrician with Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). Although he was making great money going in and out of tunnels for eight years, Mahah knew his purpose was much greater than a 9-to-5 routine. He&rsquo;s gotten laid off and starting posting his own memes and later 15-second videos to Instagram. One particular post comparing the best trucks in Caribbean culture during Labor Day Weekend became a viral sensation. Majah&rsquo;s following started growing exponentially: prompting the comic to pursue his passion for making people laugh full-time. He quit his day job and never looked back. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Frequently coming up with new characters, Majah produces about six or seven videos per day. He blazed both domestic and international stages with his prideful brand of wit: becoming a familiar face spanning Trinidad, Tobago, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, Japan, Europe, Canada, South America, and The Bahamas. Majah primarily headlines his own performances but has been honored to share stages with comedic talents such as Jason Anders, Michael Blackson, John Witherspoon, Paul Mooney, Cedric the Entertainer, Tony Woods, Brandon T. Jackson, Marlon Wayans, and Affion Crockett. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As his following continues to expand, Majah&rsquo;s objective is to remain an ambassador for his Caribbean heritage. Majah performs an annual stand-up show at the King&rsquo;s Theater every Labor Day in his hometown, Brooklyn. He launched his own production company, Hype Media and Films, in 2014. Two years later, the ambitious jokester wrote, starred in and directed an independent comedy, &ldquo;Foreign Minds Think Alike,&rdquo; where he also portrayed five characters on-screen. This year, Majah plans to launch his own nonprofit organization Hearts of Comedy for Majah Hype. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Majah has made appearances on &ldquo;The Wendy Williams Show,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Breakfast Club, &ldquo; TIDAL&rsquo;s &ldquo;Money &amp; Violence,&rdquo; and BET.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When he&rsquo;s not cracking jokes, dressing up in wigs and costumes, or poking fun using his Caribbean accents, Majah visits children&rsquo;s hospitals and supports causes like cancer, leukemia, and sickle cell anemia. Majah also frequently reads comments on his posts so that he can constantly gauge and interact with his followers, so watch out because one of Majah&rsquo;s alter egos, Mitzy, might go ham and start trolling you on Instagram!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>30<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of </strong><strong>&ldquo;The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>- - -&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In honor of the <strong>30<sup>th</sup> anniversary</strong> of <strong>Ministry&rsquo;s</strong> revolutionary album<strong> &ldquo;The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste,&rdquo; </strong>band creator <strong>Al Jourgensen</strong> decided to go old school with the celebrations, announcing <strong>The Industrial Strength Tour</strong> to kick off this summer alongside very special guests <strong>KMFDM</strong> and <strong>Front Line Assembly.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&ldquo;'The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste' </strong>just turned 30. Who knew we&rsquo;d still be around to see this day,&rdquo; says <strong>Jourgensen.</strong> &ldquo;But since we are alive and kicking, we figured we&rsquo;d hop in the way-back machine and recreate the infamous original tour with <strong>KMFDM</strong>, and add in <strong>Front Line Assembly</strong> as well. Don&rsquo;t miss it this time because we&rsquo;ll be in wheelchairs for sure in another 30 years. May the<em> fence</em> be with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&ldquo;The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste&rdquo; </strong>was released in November 1989 and features hit singles <strong>&ldquo;Thieves,&rdquo; &ldquo;Burning Inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;So What.&rdquo; </strong>The record further cemented <strong>Ministry </strong>and <strong>Jourgensen </strong>as music innovators ahead of their time, producing a voluminous, aggressive sound that became a trademark for the industrial music genre.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The <strong>Industri</strong><strong>al Strength Tour</strong> comes after a memorable 2019 for <strong>Ministry</strong> who joined <strong>Slayer</strong> on the thrash metal band&rsquo;s final dates of its <strong>Farewell World Tour</strong> and the release of a new fully authorized limited-edition visual history book, &ldquo;<strong>Ministry: Prescripture.&rdquo; </strong>Find more info here: <a href="https://www.melodicvirtue.com/collections/ministry" target="_blank">https://www.melodicvirtue.com/collections/ministry</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ABOUT MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Born in 1981 in Chicago, Ministry has been the lifetime passion project of founder Al Jourgensen, considered to be the pioneer of industrial music. In its early days, Ministry was identifiable by its heavy synth-pop material in line with the new sounds and technology that were being developed in the &lsquo;80s. Ministry&rsquo;s output began with four 12&rdquo; singles on Wax Trax! Records in 1981 before the first LP <em>With Sympathy </em>in 1983 via Arista Records.&nbsp;As time progressed however, so did Ministry, quickly developing a harsher, and more stylized sound that the band soon became infamous for on seminal albums <em>Twitch</em> (1986), <em>The Land of Rape and Honey </em>(1988), and <em>The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste</em> (1989). With the release of <em>Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and The Way to Suck Eggs</em> (1992), Ministry hit an all time high in the mainstream musical realm and received its first Grammy nomination. In total, Ministry has been nominated for a Grammy award six times. After an indefinite hiatus in 2013, Ministry&rsquo;s latest album, 2018&rsquo;s<em> AmeriKKKant</em>, continues to reflect Jourgensen&rsquo;s views on the frightening state of society and politics. With the latest lineup featuring Sin Quirin and Cesar Soto on guitars, John Bechdel (Killing Joke) on keys, London May (Samhain) on drums and Paul D&rsquo;Amour (Tool) on bass, Ministry continues touring and recording in 2020 with new music and a few more surprises planned.</p>

BERT KREISCHER is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer and host who performs to sellout crowds across the country. His stand up specials &ldquo;Secret Time&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Machine&rdquo; are currently streaming globally on Netflix. Described as having a &ldquo;rare and incredible talent&rdquo; (Interrobang), Bert has evolved from being named Rolling Stone&rsquo;s 1997 "Number One Partier in the Nation" to one of the top names in comedy. Between his two previous stand-up specials, &ldquo;The Machine&rdquo; on Showtime (2016) and &ldquo;Comfortably Dumb&rdquo; on Comedy Central (2009), his two podcasts: &ldquo;Bertcast,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Open Tabs,&rdquo; his YouTube cooking show: &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s Burning,&rdquo; his book Life of the Party: Stories of a Perpetual Man-Child(2014), Bert has succeeded in finding the elusive blend of &ldquo;being a cringe comedian with real insight&rdquo; (Interrobang).Lauded as one of the best storytellers of his generation, Bert seamlessly and sincerely shares anecdotes about his family and fatherhood while showing his ability to prove &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s a way to take his [party-boy] antics into middle-age,&rdquo; (Forbes). His infamous story about robbing a train with the Russian Mafia was recently optioned by Legendary (the studio behind The Hangover Series, Jurassic World, and Straight Outta Compton) to be turned into a movie. After the successful debut of The Body Shots World Tour in 2019, where he quickly sold out theaters and added shows in almost every market, Bert is launching a brand new tour in 2020, The Berty Boy Tour, where he will do shows in even larger venues across the country.

<p style="text-align: center;">Comedian <strong>Whitney Cummings</strong> has announced dates for her upcoming <strong>&ldquo;Touch Me&rdquo;</strong> stand up comedy tour. The fall leg of the tour will span more than 25 cities and will feature Cummings&rsquo; signature take on the current culture and the return to touring after the COVID-19 pandemic. &ldquo;Touch Me&rdquo; is a play on Cummings most recent Netflix special, &ldquo;Can I Touch It&rdquo; and will destigmatize and celebrate the importance of being together again after over 14 months of isolation. The beautiful thing about the phrase &ldquo;Touch Me&rdquo;, is that it has multiple meanings: the most obvious of course, is physical touch but there is also being touched emotionally, intellectually, spiritually and Cummings will cover it all. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Over the past few months while larger theaters have been closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, Whitney has been touring the United States, workshopping her new material in smaller rooms in preparation for her massive &ldquo;Touch Me&rdquo; theatre tour.&nbsp; During these creative workshopping sessions, Cummings has been engaging with her audience through her stand up, but also through physical touch- hugs, dancing, playful antics, etc.&nbsp; As the most prominent female voice in standup comedy, the &ldquo;Touch Me&rdquo; tour will be a big ole&rsquo; party and celebration of LIFE!&nbsp;&nbsp; The material is deeply personal, reflecting on the changes the pandemic brought to her life and her observations of today&rsquo;s society. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;Over the past year, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of time to drink but also to work on ways to connect with comedy fans through my podcast and social media, and even though we&rsquo;ve all been so far away from each other, I feel closer than ever to the people who follow me. I went from putting out a well-polished hour comedy special every couple years to sharing my personal life daily and frankly, secrets I shouldn&rsquo;t even tell my therapist. I can&rsquo;t wait to get back in venues with comedy fans and get every other disease besides Covid,&rdquo; says Cummings.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tickets for the <strong>&ldquo;Touch Me&rdquo; tour</strong> will go on sale on <strong>Friday, June 18<sup>th</sup> at 10AM</strong> local time. Pre-sale tickets will be available to fans on <strong>Wednesday, June 16 at 10am - Friday, June 18 at 9:59am</strong> local time for those following Whitney on her various social platforms. For rescheduled shows, all previously purchased tickets will be honored for the new dates listed below. For tickets and more information please visit WhitneyCummings.com. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="files/3626/George_Lopez_press_image_resized.jpg" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">George Lopez&rsquo;s multi-faceted career encompasses television, film, standup comedy, and late-night television.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lopez can be seen in his Netflix original comedy special <em>We&rsquo;ll Do It For Half </em>which premiered globally over&nbsp; the summer. Last year Lopez was on tour nationwide for his stand-up comedy <em>The Wall World.</em> He also completed his tour for <em>The Comedy Get Down</em>, along with Eddie Griffin, D.L. Hughley, and Cedric the Entertainer. The comedians also debuted their BET scripted comedy series based on the tour.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lopez has been featured in four HBO specials, <em>The Wall</em> in August 2017, <em>It&rsquo;s Not Me, It&rsquo;s You </em>in 2012, GRAMMY nominated Best Comedy Album <em>Tall, Dark and Chicano </em>in 2009, and <em>America's Mexican</em> in 2007. Lopez also performed as part of HBO and TBS's <em>Comic Relief 2006</em>. His acclaimed comedy concert, <em>Why You Crying?</em>, debuted on Showtime in 2004. He released his third standup CD, <em>El Mas Chingon</em>, in 2006, which also earned Lopez a GRAMMY nomination in the category of Best Comedy Album. In 2004, he was nominated for a GRAMMY in the same category for his CD <em>Team Leader</em>. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">He also starred in <em>Lopez</em> on TV Land.&nbsp; Produced by Lopez, the series explored how he struggled between his two worlds and crises that are often of his own making. The half hour single camera serialized comedy aired for two seasons. <em>Lopez Tonight</em>, a late-night television talk show on TBS, also ran for two seasons. It represented Lopez's return to series television after co-creating, writing, producing, and starring in Warner Bros. Television's groundbreaking hit sitcom <em>George Lopez</em>, which ran for six seasons on ABC. <em>George Lopez</em> remains a hit with viewers in syndication on both broadcast stations and cable's Nick at Nite, ranking as one of the top-rated shows on the network and among the top five comedies and top 20 weekly programs in syndication. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In film, he was last seen in the crime thriller <em>The Tax Collector</em> with Shia LaBeouf and Lana Parrilla. David Ayer wrote the screenplay and directed the film. He will be next seen in <em>Walking with Herb</em> opposite Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell. The faith-based film is inspired by Joe S. Bullock&rsquo;s novel of the same name. Lopez starred in <em>El Chicano</em> alongside Ra&uacute;l Castillo, Aimee Garcia, and Emilio Rivera. The film billed as the first Latin superhero movie, premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In 2015, Lopez was seen in the Lionsgate inspirational drama, <em>Spare Parts</em>.&nbsp; Produced by Lopez, the film is based on a true story about four undocumented Mexican-American teenagers from Phoenix who team up to build an underwater robot that wins the national robotics competition. In 2014, Lopez starred in the multi-camera ensemble comedy <em>Saint George</em> on FX, which he co-created. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lopez also voiced animated characters in a string of animated blockbuster films including Zook in <em>Gnome Alone</em>, Rafael in <em>Rio</em> and <em>Rio 2</em> along with Jamie Foxx, Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg, Thurman in <em>Escape from Planet Earth</em> opposite Jane Lynch and Sofia Vergara, Grouchy Smurf in <em>The Smurfs 1 and 2</em>, and <em>The Beverly Hills Chihuahua 1, 2, and 3</em>.&nbsp; His film credits also include the box-office hit <em>Valentine's Day</em>&nbsp;directed by Garry Marshall,&nbsp;<em>River Runs Red</em>, <em>Swing Vote</em>, <em>Henry Poole Is Here</em> and <em>Balls of Fury</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In May 2004, Lopez&rsquo;s autobiography, <em>Why You Crying?</em>, entered <em>The New York Times</em> Bestsellers List top 20. The book was co-written by Emmy winning writer and sportscaster Armen Keteyian. Lopez released his second memoir, <em>I&rsquo;m Not Gonna Lie And Other Lies You Tell When You Turn 50</em>, in 2013 where he tells the unabashed and hilarious truth about aging &ndash; as only he can.&nbsp;Lopez was also the focus of the award-winning documentary <em>Brown is the New Green: George Lopez and the American Dream</em>. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In 2006, Lopez received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In addition, Time named him one of the 25 Most Influential Hispanics in America and the Harris Poll named him one of the Top Ten Favorite Television Personalities.</p><br /><br /><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/22005AC9A162A5EB">CLICK HERE FOR TICKETS</a><br />]]></a10:content></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1747299</guid><title>Dream Theater: Top of the World Tour with special guest Arch Echo</title><description>Monday, December 13, 2021 8:00 PM - 11:00 PM - Music - Hard Rock Live Orlando - 6050 Universal Boulevard, Orlando, Florida, 32819, United States - Hard Rock Live Presents Dream Theater: Top of the World Tour with special guest Arch Echo</description><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate><a10:link href="https://www.hardrock.com/live/locations/orlando/calendar.aspx?date=12/13/2021&amp;display=event&amp;eventid=1747299" /><a10:content type="html"><![CDATA[Monday, December 13, 2021<br>8:00 PM - 11:00 PM<br>Music<br>Hard Rock Live Orlando<br>6050 Universal Boulevard<br>Orlando, Florida, 32819<br>United States<br><p><strong>$79.00&nbsp;</strong>First Two Rows &amp; Balcony Tables&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>New York, NY (July 1</strong><strong>6, 2021) &ndash; </strong>With three years since their last album, Daughtry announces new LP, <em>Dearly Beloved</em> due out September 17 and now available for PRE-ORDER TODAY <a href="https://daughtry.ffm.to/dearlybeloved">HERE</a>. The 13-track album features the <em>Billboard</em> Hard Rock Digital Songs Sales Chart #1 and Top 20 Active Rock Radio Hit &lsquo;Heavy Is the Crown,&rsquo; along with instant pre-order gift track &lsquo;Lioness&rsquo; &ndash;&ndash; AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE <a href="https://daughtry.ffm.to/lioness">HERE</a> &ndash; via Dogtree Records and ADA Worldwide. This news comes coupled with the announcement of the band&rsquo;s upcoming headlining in-person tour kicking off this November 2021 and featuring rock legends and fellow collaborators <strong>Tremonti</strong> and <strong>Travis Bracht </strong>&ndash; on sale <a href="https://daughtryofficial.com/daughtry/events">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The thirty date tour will feature the band performing recent hits and new album staples &lsquo;World On Fire&rsquo;&nbsp; and current Active Rock Radio scorcher &lsquo;Heavy Is the Crown&rsquo; along with early buzzers &lsquo;Evil&rsquo; and the award-contending &nbsp;&lsquo;Changes Are Everything.&rsquo; To hold fans and music lovers over, Daughtry serves us even more sonic art with today&rsquo;s single &lsquo;Lioness,&rsquo; &ndash; a melodic and guitar-laden gem, whose anxiously building tempo beautifully couples vocal lead, Chris Daughtry&rsquo;s unwavering tone and range. It&rsquo;s lyric video is set to premiere <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saturday July 16 at 10AM EST on YouTube </span><a href="https://daughtry.ffm.to/lionessvideo">here</a>. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dearly Beloved</span></em></strong><strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Album Tracklist</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1. DESPERATION</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. WORLD ON FIRE</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. HEAVY IS THE CROWN</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. CHANGES ARE COMING</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">5. DEARLY BELOVED</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">6. CRY FOR HELP</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">7. EVIL</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">8. ASYLUM</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">9. THE VICTIM</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">10. SOMEBODY</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">11. CALL YOU MINE</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">12. LIONESS</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">13. BREAK INTO MY HEART</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Three singles in and a beautifully engineered entry point to <em>Dearly Beloved</em> has been clearly provided and marks the yet released body of work as one of their best to date. Maintaining the direction the first two singles have offered the band, they continue to embrace their hard rock roots with new song &lsquo;Lioness,&rsquo; as previously evidenced by Chris&rsquo;s recent praised and applauded collaboration with Sevendust&rsquo;s Lajon Witherspoon for their reimagining of the hit song &lsquo;Hunger Strike (Temple of the Dog Cover)&rsquo; by Eddie Vedder and the late Chris Cornell &ndash; which continues to stand as one of their boldest moves and a &ldquo;completely different beast altogether,&rdquo; according to <em>SPIN Magazine</em>. After performances on <em>Loudwire Nights</em> and TV&rsquo;s #1 daytime talk show, <em>The Kelly Clarkson Show</em>, we can expect to see more of the band through performances for iHeart and the upcoming Recording Academy Musicares and Amy Winehouse Foundation Benefit: <em>Back to Amy</em>, where Chris will be honoring the late great singer with his own rendition of her fan favorite &lsquo;I Know I&rsquo;m No Good&rsquo; live-streaming on July 23.</p>
